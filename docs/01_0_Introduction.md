# Chapter One: Introduction to XIDs

The XID is a powerful new identifier. It's an autonomous cryptographic
object that can be used to create [truly self-sovereign
identity](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/XIDs-True-SSI/).
This first chapter introduces XIDs, shows how to create them, and
reveals how to keep them up to date.

Like the rest of this course, this chapter uses the story of
[Amira](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/amira/) to create a throughline for
the lessons. She is a software developer with a politically sensitive
background who wants to contribute to social impact projects without
risking her professional position or revealing her identity,

This course requires basic terminal/command line familiarity and the
ability to download applications through Rust's cargo utility. The
initial difficulty is "Beginner," though that may increase across the
span of the course.

## Major Objectives for this Chapter

After working through this chapter, a developer will be able to:

* Create a basic XID for pseudonymous identity.
* Create public views of a XID using elision.
* Publish a XID Document.
* Assess trust levels for pseudonymous identities.

Supporting objectives include the ability to:

* Understand what a XID is.
* Know what a pseudonymous identity is.
* Understand the power of dereferencing.
