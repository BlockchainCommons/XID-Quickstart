## What is Data Minimization?

Data minimization is the practice of limiting the data you share to only what's necessary for a specific purpose. It follows the principle: **"Share what you must, protect what you can."**

In the context of XIDs and Gordian Envelopes, data minimization means:
- Selectively revealing only relevant information
- Creating different views for different contexts
- Maintaining privacy while enabling verification
- Sharing information progressively as trust develops

## Elision: The Technical Foundation

Elision is the process of removing specific parts of a Gordian Envelope while maintaining its cryptographic integrity. 

For example, if you have an envelope:
```
"BWHacker" [
   "name": "BWHacker"
   "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
   "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
   "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
   "potentialBias": "Particular focus on privacy-preserving systems"
]
```

You can elide the "potentialBias" assertion:
```sh
ðŸ‘‰ PROFESSIONAL_XID=$(envelope elide assertion predicate string "potentialBias" "$XID_DOC")
```

Resulting in:
```
"BWHacker" [
   "name": "BWHacker"
   "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
   "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
   "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
   ELIDED
]
```

The magic of elision is that:
1. The cryptographic integrity remains intact
2. Signatures still verify
3. The envelope's structure is preserved
4. The removal of information is explicit (marked as ELIDED)

## Creating Different Views for Different Audiences

Data minimization through elision allows you to create different views of the same information for different contexts:

**Public View** (minimal information):
```
"BWHacker" [
   "name": "BWHacker"
   "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
   ELIDED
   ELIDED
   ELIDED
]
```

**Collaborator View** (more details):
```
"BWHacker" [
   "name": "BWHacker"
   "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
   "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
   "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
   ELIDED
]
```

**Partner View** (full information):
```
"BWHacker" [
   "name": "BWHacker"
   "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
   "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
   "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
   "potentialBias": "Particular focus on privacy-preserving systems"
]
```

Each view contains a different level of detail while maintaining the same cryptographic verification.

## Verification with Elided Data

A critical feature of elision is that **signatures remain valid even when parts of the envelope are elided**.

For example, if you have a signed document:
```
"API Security Enhancement" [
   "methodology": "Static analysis with open source tools"
   "limitations": "No penetration testing performed"
   "dataSources": "Public API documentation"
   SIGNATURE
]
```

You can elide the "limitations" field:
```
"API Security Enhancement" [
   "methodology": "Static analysis with open source tools"
   ELIDED
   "dataSources": "Public API documentation"
   SIGNATURE
]
```

The signature still verifies because elision preserves the cryptographic structure, even though some content is hidden.

## Progressive Disclosure Based on Trust

Data minimization enables progressive disclosure - revealing more information as trust develops:

1. **Initial Contact**: Share only basic information
   ```
   "BWHacker" [
      "name": "BWHacker"
      "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
   ]
   ```

2. **Growing Trust**: Reveal professional information
   ```
   "BWHacker" [
      "name": "BWHacker"
      "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
      "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
      "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
   ]
   ```

3. **Established Trust**: Share detailed perspectives and methods
   ```
   "BWHacker" [
      "name": "BWHacker"
      "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
      "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
      "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
      "potentialBias": "Particular focus on privacy-preserving systems"
      "methodologicalApproach": "Security-first, user-focused development"
   ]
   ```

This matches how human trust works in the real world - we don't share everything immediately but reveal more as relationships develop.

## Data Minimization Best Practices

1. **Context Sensitivity**: Tailor information for specific audiences and purposes
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Only share data necessary for the current interaction
3. **Explicit Elision**: Make it clear when information has been removed
4. **Staged Disclosure**: Create a planned progression of information sharing
5. **Audience Appropriate**: Match information detail to the trust level

## Check Your Understanding

1. What is elision and how does it support data minimization?
2. How can the same XID be presented differently to different audiences?
3. Why do signatures remain valid even after elision?
4. How does progressive disclosure mirror real-world trust building?
5. What types of information would you typically elide in different contexts?
