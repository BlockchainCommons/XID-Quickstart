## Why Data Minimization Matters

Data minimization is the practice of limiting the data you share to
only what's necessary for a specific purpose. It follows the
principle: **"Share what you must, protect what you can."**

### Privacy Risks of Excessive Data Sharing

Every piece of information shared increases potential risks:

1. **Correlation**: When data from different sources is combined, it
can reveal far more than intended. Even seemingly harmless details can
complete a revealing puzzle about a person.
2. **Secondary Use**: Once data is shared, it may be repurposed beyond
its original intent, potentially in ways that harm the subject's
interests.
3. **Disclosure Risks**: Sharing excessive data can create prejudice
or disadvantage, particularly for marginalized individuals or
communities.
4. **Digital Permanence**: Unlike conversations that fade from memory,
digital data can persist indefinitely and be copied without limit.

### Human Rights Implications

Data minimization directly supports several important human rights:

1. **Privacy**: The right to control what personal information is shared and with whom.
2. **Autonomy**: The ability to make choices without undue influence based on profiled data.
3. **Non-discrimination**: Protection from judgments made on irrelevant personal data.
4. **Security**: Reduced attack surface for identity theft and other harms.

## Beyond Anonymity and Pseudonymity

While anonymity (removing identifying data) and pseudonymity (using
alternative identifiers) are important privacy tools, they are
insufficient on their own:

1. **Anonymized data can be de-anonymized** through correlation with other datasets.
2. **Pseudonyms accumulate histories** that can eventually be linked to real identities.
3. **Contextual information** often reveals as much as direct identifiers.

Data minimization addresses these limitations by reducing all data
shared to the minimum needed for each specific interaction.

## Elision as a Data Minimization Tool

Gordian Envelope enables a powerful form of data minimization through
elision: the selective removal of specific pieces of information.  It
does so while maintaining the cryptographic integrity of the whole.

For an in-depth explanation of how elision works cryptographically,
see [Elision Cryptography](elision-cryptography.md).

## General Use Cases

Two strong use cases for data minimization are: contextual information
sharing and progressive trust.

### Contextual Information Sharing

Data minimization allows creating different views of the same identity
for different contexts:

1. **Public Context** - Share minimal, non-sensitive information
   - Basic identifiers and public credentials
   - General domain expertise
   - No personal details or private information
2. **Professional Context** - Share relevant professional information
   - Domain-specific credentials
   - Relevant experience and skills
   - Professional history without personal details
3. **Trusted Context** - Share more comprehensive information
   - Detailed professional background
   - Specific methodologies and approaches
   - Limited personal context relevant to the relationship

This contextual approach mirrors how we naturally share different
levels of information in different social contexts in the physical
world.

### Progressive Trust Development

Data minimization also enables [progressive
trust](progressive-trust.md)&mdash;revealing more information as
relationships develop:

### Trust Stages with Concrete Examples

1. **Initial Contact**: Share only basic information.
   ```
   "BRadvoc8" [
      "name": "BRadvoc8"
      "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
   ]
   ```

2. **Building Relationship**: Reveal professional information.
   ```
   "BRadvoc8" [
      "name": "BRadvoc8"
      "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
      "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
      "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
   ]
   ```

3. **Growing Trust**: Share more specific professional details.
   ```
   "BRadvoc8" [
      "name": "BRadvoc8"
      "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
      "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
      "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
      "skillAreas": "API security, Zero-knowledge systems, Protocol design"
   ]
   ```

4. **Established Trust**: Reveal detailed perspectives and methods.
   ```
   "BRadvoc8" [
      "name": "BRadvoc8"
      "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
      "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
      "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
      "skillAreas": "API security, Zero-knowledge systems, Protocol design"
      "potentialBias": "Particular focus on privacy-preserving systems"
      "methodologicalApproach": "Security-first, user-focused development"
   ]
   ```

This staged approach allows relationships to develop naturally, with
information sharing matching the level of established trust&mdash;just
as we share different levels of personal information at different
stages of relationships in the physical world.

## Data Minimization Best Practices

1. **Purpose Analysis**: Clearly identify why information is being shared and what the minimum required is.
2. **Contextual Assessment**: Consider the specific audience and their legitimate need to know.
3. **Differential Disclosure**: Create multiple views of the same information for different contexts.
4. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess whether previously shared information should be updated or withdrawn.
5. **Transparency about Minimization**: Make it clear when information has been minimized to set expectations.

## Real-World Use Cases

Data minimization principles apply to many scenarios:

1. **Age Verification**: Proving someone is over 21 without revealing exact birthdate.
2. **Professional Credentials**: Demonstrating qualifications without exposing personal history.
3. **Financial Verification**: Proving financial capacity without revealing account details.
4. **Identity Authentication**: Verifying identity without exposing the full identity document.
5. **Collaboration**: Sharing relevant expertise without unnecessary personal disclosure.

## From Principles to Practice

Understanding data minimization principles is one thing; implementing
them effectively is another. Here's how these principles translate
into practical action with Gordian Envelopes:

### Practical Implementation of Data Minimization

1. **Create a Complete Source Document**
   - Begin with a comprehensive envelope containing all possible information.
   - Use careful organization of assertions for later selective sharing.
   - Include both essential and contextual information.
2. **Identify Context-Based Sharing Requirements**
   - Define specific audiences and what each needs to know.
   - Create profiles for different sharing contexts (public, professional, trusted).
   - Determine what information is appropriate for each trust level.
3. **Implement Through Elision**
   - Sign documents before elision to maintain verifiability.
   - Use elision to create different views of the same document.
   - Execute with the `envelope elide` operation in Gordian Envelope.
4. **Visually Indicate Data Minimization**

For instance, a professional profile shared in a public context would visually indicate elided content:

```
"BRadvoc8" [
   "name": "BRadvoc8"
   "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcx...
   "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
   ELIDED
   ELIDED
   ELIDED
]
```

The `ELIDED` markers make it clear to recipients that information has
been intentionally minimized rather than simply omitted. This
transparency builds trust by acknowledging the data minimization
process.
