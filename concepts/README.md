## Introduction to XIDs and Gordian Architecture

The XID-Quickstart tutorial introduces developers to the Gordian architectureâ€”a comprehensive technology stack developed by Blockchain Commons that embodies the principles of self-sovereign identity, data minimization, and progressive trust building. 

The Gordian architecture consists of several components that work together to enable user-controlled digital identity and data:
- **XIDs** (eXtensible IDentifiers): Privacy-respecting digital identifiers
- **Gordian Envelopes**: Smart document format for selective disclosure
- **Cryptographic libraries**: Underlying tools for security and verification

XIDs demonstrate how the Gordian architecture enables:
- **Self-sovereign identity**: Complete user control over digital identity
- **Data minimization**: Sharing only what's necessary in each context
- **Progressive trust**: Building verifiable reputation over time
- **Key resilience**: Maintaining identity stability through key changes

By understanding these concepts, you'll learn how to create systems where users maintain complete control over their digital identities while selectively building verifiable reputation.

## Core Concepts

If you're new to XIDs and Gordian Envelopes, start with these fundamental concepts:

   - *Creating balanced, verifiable claims with appropriate evidence*

3. [Progressive Trust](progressive-trust.md) - Building trust incrementally over time
   - *Trust development as a multi-phase lifecycle with 10 distinct phases*
   - *Moving through stages from initial contact to trusted relationship*

4. [Pseudonymous Trust Building](pseudonymous-trust-building.md) - Building trust without revealing identity
   - *Creating reputation without disclosing legal identity*
   - *Balancing privacy protection with meaningful contribution*
   - *Methods for establishing credibility pseudonymously*

## Privacy & Identity Concepts

These concepts explore additional aspects of privacy, identity, and key management:

1. [Public Participation Profiles](public-participation-profiles.md) - Managing public identity and reputation
   - *Structured frameworks for participating in public projects*
   - *Balancing privacy needs with contribution desires*
   - *Risk-reward calculus for different disclosure levels*

2. [Public Participation Profile Examples](public-participation-profile-examples.md) - Concrete examples of participation profiles
   - *Practical implementations of participation profiles using XIDs*
   - *Context-specific profile views through selective disclosure*
   - *Comprehensive assertion taxonomy for different trust levels*

3. [Key Management Essentials](key-management.md) - Securing and managing cryptographic keys
   - *Best practices for key creation, storage, and rotation*
   - *Recovery strategies for lost or compromised keys*
   - *Progressive permissions for different security contexts*
