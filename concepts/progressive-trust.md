## Introduction

**Progressive Trust** is an approach to digital trust that mirrors how human trust works in the real world. Rather than binary "trust or don't trust" decisions, progressive trust acknowledges that trust develops gradually, evolves over time, and exists in shades of gray rather than black and white.

**"The basic idea behind progressive trust is to model how trust works in the real world"**
â€”Christopher Allen, [Musings of a Trust Architect: Progressive Trust](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust/) (December 2022)

Traditional digital systems often rely on centralized authorities and binary trust decisions. Progressive trust instead restores human choice and agency by enabling nuanced, contextual trust evaluations that can adjust based on new evidence and interactions.

## The Progressive Trust Life Cycle

The Progressive Trust Life Cycle consists of ten phases that reflect how trust evolves in human interactions. XIDs and Gordian Envelopes provide ideal tools for implementing this life cycle in digital systems.

### Phase 0: Context *(Interaction Considered)*

Before trust formation begins, parties consider whether an interaction requires progressive trust at all.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
INTERACTION_CONTEXT=$(envelope subject type string "Software Contribution Evaluation")
INTERACTION_CONTEXT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "interactionType" string "Code Contribution Review" "$INTERACTION_CONTEXT")
INTERACTION_CONTEXT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "riskLevel" string "Medium - Production System Component" "$INTERACTION_CONTEXT")
INTERACTION_CONTEXT=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "trustModelRequired" string "Progressive" "$INTERACTION_CONTEXT")
```

In this phase, we establish that this interaction (evaluating a software contribution) warrants a progressive trust approach due to its risk level.

### Phase 1: Introduction *(Assertions Declared)*

Parties make initial declarations and reveal some information while eliding other data.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Developer declares their identity and code contribution
DEVELOPER_DECLARATION=$(envelope subject type string "Code Contribution #PR-123")
DEVELOPER_DECLARATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "contributor" string "$DEVELOPER_XID" "$DEVELOPER_DECLARATION")
DEVELOPER_DECLARATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "repositoryURL" string "https://github.com/example/project" "$DEVELOPER_DECLARATION")
DEVELOPER_DECLARATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "commitHash" string "7dd42c1be02cc53f70bfd0021d0aac15bf8e2ad5" "$DEVELOPER_DECLARATION")
DEVELOPER_DECLARATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "description" string "Add authentication module" "$DEVELOPER_DECLARATION")
DEVELOPER_DECLARATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "experience" string "5 years Node.js development" "$DEVELOPER_DECLARATION")
```

Here, the developer introduces themselves and their contribution, revealing their XID, the specific contribution details, and relevant experience. 

### Phase 2: Wholeness *(Integrity Assessed)*

The data assets are checked for their structural integrity and completeness.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Automated checks verify the structure and format of the contribution
INTEGRITY_CHECK=$(envelope subject type envelope "$DEVELOPER_DECLARATION")
INTEGRITY_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "lintCheck" string "Passed - 0 errors, 2 warnings" "$INTEGRITY_CHECK")
INTEGRITY_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "compilationCheck" string "Successful" "$INTEGRITY_CHECK")
INTEGRITY_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "testCoverage" string "92% (meets minimum 90%)" "$INTEGRITY_CHECK")
INTEGRITY_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "assessedBy" string "ContinuousIntegrationSystem" "$INTEGRITY_CHECK")
INTEGRITY_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "assessmentDate" string "2023-11-28T14:30:00Z" "$INTEGRITY_CHECK")
```

This phase verifies that the contribution is structurally sound - it compiles, passes linting, and has sufficient test coverage.

### Phase 3: Proofs *(Secrets Verified)*

Cryptographic secrets and other hidden information are verified.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Verify cryptographic proofs of the contribution and identity
VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION=$(envelope subject type envelope "$INTEGRITY_CHECK")
VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "commitSignatureVerified" string "Valid signature from $DEVELOPER_XID" "$VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION")
VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "xidDocumentVerified" string "Valid" "$VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION")
VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "verificationMethod" string "SSH ED25519 signature verification" "$VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION")
VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "verifiedBy" string "RepositoryVerifier" "$VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION")
```

This phase cryptographically verifies the developer's identity (via their XID) and the authenticity of their code contribution (via commit signature).

### Phase 4: References *(Trust Affirmed)*

Collect trust references from various sources to build a composite trust picture.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Collect trust references about the contributor
TRUST_REFERENCES=$(envelope subject type envelope "$VERIFIED_CONTRIBUTION")
TRUST_REFERENCES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "previousContributions" string "27 accepted PRs" "$TRUST_REFERENCES")
TRUST_REFERENCES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "averageCodeQuality" string "4.2/5.0 from peer reviews" "$TRUST_REFERENCES")
TRUST_REFERENCES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "communityStanding" string "Active contributor since 2020" "$TRUST_REFERENCES")
TRUST_REFERENCES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "codeReviewHistory" string "93% approval rate" "$TRUST_REFERENCES")
TRUST_REFERENCES=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "referencesCollectedBy" string "$MAINTAINER_XID" "$TRUST_REFERENCES")
```

Here, the project maintainer collects references about the developer from past interactions, peer reviews, and community standing.

### Phase 5: Requirements *(Community Compliance)*

The collected data is audited against community standards and requirements.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Audit the contribution against project requirements
COMPLIANCE_CHECK=$(envelope subject type envelope "$TRUST_REFERENCES")
COMPLIANCE_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "securityReviewResult" string "Passed - No vulnerabilities detected" "$COMPLIANCE_CHECK")
COMPLIANCE_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "codeStyleCompliance" string "Compliant with project standards" "$COMPLIANCE_CHECK")
COMPLIANCE_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "documentationCompliance" string "Meets requirements - includes API docs" "$COMPLIANCE_CHECK")
COMPLIANCE_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "breakingChanges" string "None - API backward compatible" "$COMPLIANCE_CHECK")
COMPLIANCE_CHECK=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "auditedBy" string "SecurityTeam" "$COMPLIANCE_CHECK")
```

The contribution is audited against project requirements including security standards, code style, documentation, and API compatibility.

### Phase 6: Approval *(Risk Calculated)*

The risk of the interaction is assessed against a risk model.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Calculate risk and make approval decision
RISK_CALCULATION=$(envelope subject type envelope "$COMPLIANCE_CHECK")
RISK_CALCULATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "moduleImpact" string "Medium - Core authentication component" "$RISK_CALCULATION")
RISK_CALCULATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "trustScore" string "0.87" "$RISK_CALCULATION")
RISK_CALCULATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "riskLevel" string "Low - Sufficient tests and reviews" "$RISK_CALCULATION")
RISK_CALCULATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "approvalDecision" string "Approved for integration" "$RISK_CALCULATION")
RISK_CALCULATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "approvedBy" string "$MAINTAINER_XID" "$RISK_CALCULATION")
RISK_CALCULATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "approvalDate" string "2023-11-30T09:15:00Z" "$RISK_CALCULATION")
```

Based on all previous phases, the maintainer calculates the risk level, compares it to the trust score, and makes an approval decision.

### Phase 7: Agreement *(Threshold Endorsed)* [optional]

Additional approvals are obtained to reach a required threshold.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Collect additional approvals to reach threshold
THRESHOLD_APPROVAL=$(envelope subject type envelope "$RISK_CALCULATION")
THRESHOLD_APPROVAL=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "additionalApprover1" string "$SENIOR_DEV_XID" "$THRESHOLD_APPROVAL")
THRESHOLD_APPROVAL=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "approval1Date" string "2023-11-30T10:20:00Z" "$THRESHOLD_APPROVAL")
THRESHOLD_APPROVAL=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "additionalApprover2" string "$SECURITY_TEAM_XID" "$THRESHOLD_APPROVAL")
THRESHOLD_APPROVAL=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "approval2Date" string "2023-11-30T11:45:00Z" "$THRESHOLD_APPROVAL")
THRESHOLD_APPROVAL=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "thresholdReached" string "Yes - All required approvals obtained" "$THRESHOLD_APPROVAL")
```

For this core component, additional approvals are required from a senior developer and the security team before proceeding.

### Phase 8: Fulfillment *(Interaction Finalized)*

The interaction is finalized according to the agreed-upon terms.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Finalize the contribution
INTERACTION_FULFILLED=$(envelope subject type envelope "$THRESHOLD_APPROVAL")
INTERACTION_FULFILLED=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "mergeStatus" string "Merged to main branch" "$INTERACTION_FULFILLED")
INTERACTION_FULFILLED=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "mergeCommit" string "cf37d69cea18b344d2c9e8aacc430b1d9ac0a74a" "$INTERACTION_FULFILLED")
INTERACTION_FULFILLED=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "deploymentStatus" string "Deployed to staging environment" "$INTERACTION_FULFILLED")
INTERACTION_FULFILLED=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "fulfillmentDate" string "2023-12-01T08:30:00Z" "$INTERACTION_FULFILLED")
INTERACTION_FULFILLED=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "finalizedBy" string "DeploymentSystem" "$INTERACTION_FULFILLED")
```

The code contribution is merged and deployed, finalizing the interaction.

### Phase 9: Escalation *(Independently Inspected)* [optional]

A third party inspects and potentially endorses the interaction.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Independent security audit of the deployed code
INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION=$(envelope subject type envelope "$INTERACTION_FULFILLED")
INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "auditFirm" string "SecureCode Auditors" "$INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION")
INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "auditDate" string "2023-12-05T14:00:00Z" "$INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION")
INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "auditScope" string "Authentication module security review" "$INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION")
INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "auditResult" string "Passed - No critical or high vulnerabilities" "$INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION")
INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "auditReport" string "sha256:7d8f9a234c9b67531d5f8b3a1b5d9c7e9a6b7c8d" "$INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION")
```

An independent security firm audits the deployed code, providing additional assurance about its quality and security.

### Phase 10: Dispute *(Independently Arbitrated)* [optional]

If something goes wrong, a dispute process resolves issues through independent arbitration.

**XID Implementation:**
```sh
# Handle a security vulnerability discovered after deployment
DISPUTE_RESOLUTION=$(envelope subject type envelope "$INDEPENDENT_INSPECTION")
DISPUTE_RESOLUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "disputeRaised" string "Security vulnerability CVE-2023-98765" "$DISPUTE_RESOLUTION")
DISPUTE_RESOLUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "disputeDate" string "2023-12-10T09:30:00Z" "$DISPUTE_RESOLUTION")
DISPUTE_RESOLUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "raisedBy" string "SecurityResearcher" "$DISPUTE_RESOLUTION")
DISPUTE_RESOLUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "vulnerabilityDetails" string "Authentication bypass in edge case" "$DISPUTE_RESOLUTION")
DISPUTE_RESOLUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "arbitrator" string "OpenSourceSecurityCommittee" "$DISPUTE_RESOLUTION")
DISPUTE_RESOLUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "resolution" string "Developer acknowledged and fixed issue within 24 hours" "$DISPUTE_RESOLUTION")
DISPUTE_RESOLUTION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "trustImpact" string "Minimal - Prompt and transparent response" "$DISPUTE_RESOLUTION")
```

When a vulnerability is discovered, the dispute resolution process documents the issue, assigns responsibility, and tracks the resolution, including the impact on trust.

## Progressive Trust and Fair Witness Assertions

The Progressive Trust Life Cycle aligns naturally with the Fair Witness assertions model already implemented in the xid-sandbox:

1. **Fair Witness Assertions** provide a foundation for making verifiable claims with context, while the **Progressive Trust Life Cycle** defines how these assertions evolve over time.

2. **Observation Context** in Fair Witness maps to the Introduction, Wholeness, and Proofs phases of Progressive Trust.

3. **Endorsements** in Fair Witness implement the References, Requirements, and Approval phases of Progressive Trust.

4. **Meta-Assertions** support the Agreement, Fulfillment, Escalation, and Dispute phases of Progressive Trust.

5. **Selective Disclosure** capabilities of Gordian Envelopes enable privacy-preserving progressive trust by revealing appropriate information at each phase.

## Trust Networks and Multiple Contexts

Progressive trust doesn't exist in isolation - it forms a network of trust relationships across different contexts:

```text
Person A -- trusts --> Person B   (in context X with trust level 0.8)
                    -- trusts --> Person C   (in context Y with trust level 0.6)
                    
Person B -- trusts --> Person D   (in context X with trust level 0.7)

Person C -- trusts --> Person D   (in context Y with trust level 0.9)
```

This means Person A might derive indirect trust of Person D through different paths with different trust levels in different contexts.

XIDs provide stable identifiers for entities across these trust networks, while Gordian Envelopes enable context-specific trust assertions and selective disclosure.

## Implementing Progressive Trust with XIDs

To implement progressive trust using XIDs:

1. **Create XIDs for all entities** in your trust network

2. **Define trust contexts** as specific domains of interaction (e.g., "code review," "document attestation")

3. **Use the life cycle phases** to track progression of trust in each context

4. **Document trust assertions** using Gordian Envelopes with appropriate attestations and endorsements

5. **Implement selective disclosure** to reveal appropriate information based on trust level

6. **Build trust scores** that adapt based on successful progression through the life cycle phases

7. **Track trust history** to enable evolution of trust over time

## Conclusion

Progressive trust using XIDs enables a more human-centered approach to digital trust that evolves gradually, considers context, and supports nuanced trust decisions rather than binary choices.

By implementing the Progressive Trust Life Cycle with XIDs and Gordian Envelopes, we can create digital systems that better reflect how trust works in the real world - as a gradual, evidence-based process that exists in shades of gray rather than black and white.
