# Creating Your First XID

This tutorial introduces Amira, a software developer with a politically sensitive background who wants to contribute to social impact projects without risking her professional position or revealing her identity. By the end, you'll have created an XID (eXtensible IDentifier) that enables pseudonymous contributions while building trust progressively.

**Time to complete: 15-20 minutes**

- How to sign a basic attestation with your XID
- How to maintain pseudonymity while contributing to projects

## Amira's Story: Why Pseudonymous Identity Matters

Amira is a successful software developer working at a prestigious bank. Given her background from a politically tense region, she wants to contribute to social impact projects in her free time without risking her day job or facing potential discrimination. She needs a way to:

1. Share her expertise without revealing her real identity
2. Build trust through the quality of her work, not her credentials
3. Establish a consistent digital presence that can evolve over time

This is where XIDs come in - they enable pseudonymous identity with progressive trust development.

## 1. Creating a Secure Foundation with Keys

First, Amira needs to generate cryptographic keys as the foundation for her pseudonymous identity. She'll create both SSH keys for Git operations and XID keys for her digital identity.

Generate an SSH key for Git authentication and commit signing:

üëâ 
```sh
SSH_KEY_FILE="./amira-ssh-key"
SSH_PUB_KEY_FILE="${SSH_KEY_FILE}.pub"
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "$SSH_KEY_FILE" -N "" -C "BWHacker <bwhacker@example.com>"
```

This creates an SSH key pair that Amira can use for signing Git commits and authenticating to GitHub, all while using her pseudonym.

Extract the SSH public key and fingerprint:

üëâ 
```sh
SSH_PUB_KEY=$(cat "$SSH_PUB_KEY_FILE")
SSH_KEY_FINGERPRINT=$(ssh-keygen -l -E sha256 -f "$SSH_PUB_KEY_FILE" | awk '{print $2}')
echo "SSH public key fingerprint: $SSH_KEY_FINGERPRINT"
```

üîç 
```console
SSH public key fingerprint: SHA256:dFbxBGrqMQNJKpZccInX7l/QE1xH/jNzDvUo/jICSHE
```

Now, generate a separate private key for her XID:

üëâ 
```sh
envelope generate prvkeys > amira-key.private
echo "Private key generated - keep this secret and secure!"
```

üîç 
```console
Private key generated - keep this secret and secure!
```

This XID private key must be kept secure - it's what Amira will use to prove ownership of her identity document without revealing who she is.

Derive the corresponding public key from the private key:

üëâ 
```sh
PRIVATE_KEYS=$(cat amira-key.private)
PUBLIC_KEYS=$(envelope generate pubkeys "$PRIVATE_KEYS")
echo "$PUBLIC_KEYS" > amira-key.public
```

View the public key (which is safe to share):

üëâ 
```sh
cat amira-key.public | head -n 1
```

üîç 
```console
ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcxlkadjnghfejtmyyloeadmyfqzswdaeayfnmddpjygtmyaeaelytsqdisaeaeaeae
```

## 2. Creating a Minimal Pseudonymous XID

Next, Amira creates an XID with her pseudonym "BWHacker" (Better World Hacker), which she'll use for contributing to projects that align with her values.

Create the pseudonymous XID:

üëâ 
```sh
envelope xid new --name "BWHacker" "$PUBLIC_KEYS" > amira-xid.envelope
```

View the minimal XID structure:

üëâ 
```sh
XID_DOC=$(cat amira-xid.envelope)
envelope format --type tree "$XID_DOC"
```

üîç 
```console
"BWHacker" [
   "name": "BWHacker"
   "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcxlkadjnghfejtmyyloeadmyfqzswdaeayfnmddpjygtmyaeaelytsqdisaeaeaeae
]
```

This minimal structure only reveals her chosen pseudonym, nothing about her real identity or background.

## 3. Understanding the XID Identifier

Extract the unique XID identifier that will represent her consistently:

üëâ 
```sh
XID_ID=$(envelope xid id "$XID_DOC")
echo "XID identifier: $XID_ID"
```

üîç 
```console
XID identifier: 7e1e25d7c4b9e4c92753f4476158e972be2fbbd9dffdd13b0561b5f1177826d3
```

This identifier is derived cryptographically but remains stable even if Amira later updates her keys. Others can consistently reference this identifier without knowing Amira's real identity.

## 4. Adding GitHub Identity with SSH Key Verification

Amira now wants to create a verifiable link between her XID and her GitHub activity, without revealing her real identity.

Add her GitHub identity:

üëâ 
```sh
XID_DOC=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "gitHubUsername" string "BWHacker" "$XID_DOC")
XID_DOC=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "gitHubProfileURL" string "https://github.com/BWHacker" "$XID_DOC")
```

Link her SSH key to enable verification of her Git commits:

üëâ 
```sh
XID_DOC=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "sshKey" string "$SSH_PUB_KEY" "$XID_DOC")
XID_DOC=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "sshKeyFingerprint" string "$SSH_KEY_FINGERPRINT" "$XID_DOC")
XID_DOC=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "sshKeyVerificationURL" string "https://api.github.com/users/BWHacker/ssh_signing_keys" "$XID_DOC")
```

Add basic professional information:

üëâ 
```sh
XID_DOC=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "domain" string "Distributed Systems & Security" "$XID_DOC")
XID_DOC=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "experienceLevel" string "8 years professional practice" "$XID_DOC")
```

Save the updated XID:

üëâ 
```sh
echo "$XID_DOC" > amira-xid.envelope
```

View the enhanced XID:

üëâ 
```sh
envelope format --type tree "$XID_DOC"
```

üîç 
```console
"BWHacker" [
   "name": "BWHacker"
   "publicKeys": ur:crypto-pubkeys/hdcxlkadjnghfejtmyyloeadmyfqzswdaeayfnmddpjygtmyaeaelytsqdisaeaeaeae
   "gitHubUsername": "BWHacker"
   "gitHubProfileURL": "https://github.com/BWHacker"
   "sshKey": "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC... BWHacker <bwhacker@example.com>"
   "sshKeyFingerprint": "SHA256:dFbxBGrqMQNJKpZccInX7l/QE1xH/jNzDvUo/jICSHE"
   "sshKeyVerificationURL": "https://api.github.com/users/BWHacker/ssh_signing_keys"
   "domain": "Distributed Systems & Security"
   "experienceLevel": "8 years professional practice"
]
```

## 5. Organizing Your XID Files

Organize the XID and SSH key information in a project directory:

üëâ 
```sh
mkdir -p output
cp amira-xid.envelope output/amira-xid.envelope
cp "$SSH_KEY_FILE" output/
cp "$SSH_PUB_KEY_FILE" output/
ls -la output/
```

üîç 
```console
total 32
drwxr-xr-x  5 user  staff  160 Apr 29 14:32 .
drwxr-xr-x  7 user  staff  224 Apr 29 14:32 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  524 Apr 29 14:32 amira-xid.envelope
-rw-------  1 user  staff  419 Apr 29 14:32 amira-ssh-key
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  110 Apr 29 14:32 amira-ssh-key.pub
```

## 6. Creating and Signing a Basic Attestation

Now Amira will create a simple attestation about her skills and sign it with her XID key:

üëâ 
```sh
ATTESTATION=$(envelope subject type string "Skill Attestation")
ATTESTATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "skill" string "Rust Programming" "$ATTESTATION")
ATTESTATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "experienceYears" string "3" "$ATTESTATION")
ATTESTATION=$(envelope assertion add pred-obj string "projectCount" string "5" "$ATTESTATION")
```

Sign the attestation with her private key:

üëâ 
```sh
SIGNED_ATTESTATION=$(envelope sign -s "$PRIVATE_KEYS" "$ATTESTATION")
echo "$SIGNED_ATTESTATION" > output/skill-attestation-signed.envelope
```

View the signed attestation:

üëâ 
```sh
envelope format --type tree "$SIGNED_ATTESTATION"
```

üîç 
```console
"Skill Attestation" [
   "skill": "Rust Programming"
   "experienceYears": "3"
   "projectCount": "5"
   SIGNATURE
]
```

Verify the signature to confirm it came from the XID holder:

üëâ 
```sh
if envelope verify -v "$PUBLIC_KEYS" "$SIGNED_ATTESTATION"; then
    echo "‚úÖ Signature verified. The attestation is authentically from the XID holder."
  else
    echo "‚ùå Signature verification failed."
  fi
```

üîç 
```console
‚úÖ Signature verified. The attestation is authentically from the XID holder.
```

## 7. Configuring Git for SSH Key Signing

Finally, Amira sets up Git to use her SSH key for signing commits, creating a link between her XID and her Git contributions:

üëâ 
```sh
echo "Git configuration commands for SSH signing:"
echo "git config --local user.name \"BWHacker\""
echo "git config --local user.email \"bwhacker@example.com\""
echo "git config --local user.signingkey \"$SSH_KEY_FILE\""
echo "git config --local gpg.format ssh"
echo "git config --local commit.gpgsign true"
```

üîç 
```console
Git configuration commands for SSH signing:
git config --local user.name "BWHacker"
git config --local user.email "bwhacker@example.com"
git config --local user.signingkey "./amira-ssh-key"
git config --local gpg.format ssh
git config --local commit.gpgsign true
```

With this configuration, all of Amira's Git commits will be signed with the same SSH key referenced in her XID.

## Understanding What Happened

1. **Privacy-Preserving Identity**: Amira created a pseudonymous XID that allows her to contribute without revealing her real identity.

2. **SSH Key Integration**: She generated an SSH key for her pseudonymous identity and included it in her XID to enable Git commit signing.

3. **Minimal Yet Verifiable**: She created a simple identity with just enough information to be useful, while maintaining her privacy.

4. **Signature Verification**: She demonstrated how signatures can verify that content came from her pseudonymous identity.

5. **GitHub Connection**: The SSH key creates a verifiable link between her XID and her GitHub activity.

## Next Steps

In the next tutorial, we'll explore the structure of Amira's XID in detail and understand how XIDs work under the hood with Gordian Envelopes.

## Exercises

1. Create your own XID with a pseudonym and SSH key.

2. Add different assertions to your XID that express your skills without revealing your identity.

3. Create and sign a simple attestation with your XID private key.

4. Configure a local Git repository to use your SSH key for signing commits.

5. Try creating a minimal XID with just a name and public key, then gradually add more information.
